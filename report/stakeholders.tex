\section*{Stakeholders}
We have identified the following stakeholders as being relevant for the project:
\begin{itemize}
\item Car owners. These are the users of the systems and the holder of the smartcards.
They will typically want easy usable systems and a certain degree of privacy. 
Some of them may try to bypass the system to get more fuel than allowed.

\item Local petrol station owners. They will have to modify their pumping installations to 
work with terminals. They typically want low costs and low interaction for maintenance.

\item Petrol companies with multiple pumping stations. They will have to modify their
pumping installations to work with terminals. They typically want low costs and 
low interaction. When possible, they might attempt to track customers via their smartcard.

\item The government. They are the ones who want this system in place, to be able to regulate
the fuel consumption. They typically want the system to be secure and fair.
\end{itemize}
